        <h3>The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGs/tag_noscript.asp" target="_blank"> &lt;noscript&gt;</a> tag</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            This tag is an alternate definition flag with the purpose of only being displayed for those who do not have scripts enabled or supported in their current browser. With this, it's a way to not completely alienate those unable to see script specific information in a given webpage, something I wouldn't want to have occur.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h3>The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGs/tag_select.asp">&lt;select&gt;</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGs/tag_option.asp" target="_blank">&lt;option&gt;</a> tags</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            These tags work alongside each other as a way to create a list of options for the sake of processing the user's personal input, making it very critical for any site that would have a use for user input, such as needing to swap a specified language or color requirement. The input and subsequent response from these tags are useful for both being able to accommodate others and be capable to change differing options for the page's contents, such as changing the colors of a car model.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>As I progress through this class, I look forward to fully understanding how to utilize these aforementioned tags and the many others this programming language offers.</p>
